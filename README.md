Grafana. It supports the following migration scenarios:

```console
amazon-managed-grafana-migrator migrate \
  --src-url https://grafana.example.com/
  --src-api-key API_KEY_HERE
  --dst g-abcdef5678.grafana-workspace.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
  --dst-service-account-id SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE

```

Or for v9+ workspaces:

```console
amazon-managed-grafana-migrator migrate \
